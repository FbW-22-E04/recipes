# jamaican curry chicken

While curry might not sound like the typical dinner rut for some, whenever I’m not sure what to cook and need an easy meal (soooo almost every night), curry is one of my defaults: Thai Chicken Curry, Slow Cooker Chicken Curry, and Coconut Curry are three frequent menu items.

This Jamaican curry chicken is different.

While it has some of the usual curry ingredients like coconut milk and spices, the heat has a subtle sweetness to it and the spices are more warm than other curries.

The sauce is thick and rich, so this curry is comforting on a chilly evening if that’s when you are craving it, but the spices also work surprisingly well on even the hottest summer day. I suspect that’s why curry is so popular in countries known for their warm climates, like India and the Caribbean.

Traditional Jamaican curry is made with scotch bonnet peppers and Jamaican curry powder, neither of which I have easy access to here in Milwaukee.

As with any culturally inspired recipe, from my Instant Pot Chicken Tikka Masala to this Slow Cooker Butter Chicken, I’ll never ask you to go from store to store hunting for specialty ingredients. If I can’t find them, I know there’s a good chance you can’t either, which is why I jerry-rigged this recipe to have the same flavor profile, without actually using these two.

How to Make Jamaican Curry Chicken
This is an adapted, easy-ingredient version of traditional Jamaican curry chicken. If you want authentic flavor, made over to be healthy and done with ingredients you can find at the average American supermarket, you’ve come to the right place.
