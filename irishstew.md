***1. Gather the ingredients.***

***2. In a large frying pan, sauté the bacon. Drain the fat and reserve both the bacon and the fat.***

***3. In a large mixing bowl, place the lamb, salt, pepper, and flour. Toss to coat the meat evenly.***

***4. Without cleaning, reheat the frying pan you used to fry the bacon. In batches, brown the lamb in the reserved bacon fat. If you run out of fat, use some of the vegetable oil.***

***5. Transfer the browned meat to a 10-quart stove top casserole, leaving about 1/4 cup of fat in the frying pan.***

***6. Add the garlic and the chopped yellow onion to the pan and sauté until the onion begins to color a bit.***

***7. Add the garlic-onion mixture to the casserole, along with the reserved bacon pieces, beef stock, and sugar.***

***8. Cover and simmer for 1 1/2 hours, or until the lamb is tender.***

***9. Add the carrots, the sliced onions, potatoes, thyme, bay leaf, and wine to the pot and simmer, covered, for about 20 minutes, or until the vegetables are  tender. Taste test and add salt and pepper as needed.***

***10. Top with the parsley garnish before serving and accompany with soda bread.***

***11. Enjoy.***
