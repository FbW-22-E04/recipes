## How to make tofu scramble – Step by step

1. Chop the tofu and use a fork to crumble it into bite-sized pieces.
2. Heat some oil in a pan or a large skillet and add the tofu and all the remaining ingredients. 
3. Stir and cook over medium-high heat for 5 to 10 minutes.
4. Serve your tofu scramble immediately over some toasts and topped it with fresh parsley.

### Pro tips

* Feel free to use any type of salt to make your tofu scrambled eggs, although I prefer to use Kala Namak salt (also known as Himalayan black salt) because it gives it an eggy taste.
* If you’re not a turmeric lover or you’re not used to its flavor, add only 1/8 tsp of turmeric powder, then try the tofu scramble and add more of it if needed.
* Add your favorite spices, veggies, or ingredients.
* Feel free to combine all the spices into a small bowl before incorporating them into the skillet if it is more comfortable for you.
* To make this recipe, I’d use firm or extra-firm tofu instead of silken tofu.
* If you’re oil-free, just make this tofu scramble recipe with some water or vegetable stock instead.
