​
## What is Fattoush?
​
​
Fattoush is basically a Mediterranean fried bread salad that typically includes lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, radishes and fried pieces of pita bread. You’ll also typically see green peppers, green onions and parsley.
​
In Arabic, the word “fattoush” is derived from “fatteh” which literally means “crumbs.” As you can imagine, this Fattoush Salad is basically a hodgepodge of pita bread that’s been seasoned then fried (or baked) in addition to other vegetables that are in season. For that reason, there are no rules when it comes to the vegetables you use in Fattoush! It’s a great base recipe that you can build upon and dress up how you’d like.
​
TYPICAL INGREDIENTS
​
- Lettuce: Romaine lettuce.
- Parsley: Chop it up finely to add a fresh brightness to the salad.
- Mint Leaves
- Tomatoes
- Green peppers: Other types of sweet or spicy peppers work too.
- Cucumbers: It’s a key ingredient in many Middle Eastern salads, especially this one. Any cucumbers work, but Persian cucumbers are most popular.
Green onions: While you can use white, yellow or red onions, green onions have a sweeter and more mellow flavor so they don’t overpower the dressing.
- Radishes: Try throwing radishes in fattoush to add a mild spicy and zesty flavor that’s crisp and fresh.
- Pomegranate
- Sumaq 
- Salt
- Olive Oil

# HOW TO MAKE FATTOUSH SALAD
​
# CHOP THE INGREDIENTS
​
- It’s a good idea to small dice all the ingredients so that every bite of fattoush is complete with all the textures and flavors of the salads.
​
# MAKE THE DRESSING
​
- Made with extra virgin olive oil, fresh lemon juice, mint, sumac. This zesty dressing is what separates authentic fattoush from all other fattoush. It helps the salad come together with a distinguished taste.
​
# FRY OT TOAST THE LEBANESE PITA BREAD
Cut the pita into the desired shapes (triangles, squares or strips). Toss with olive oil, salt and pepper and fry on medium heat.
Make sure to stir frequently until the pita bread is lightly golden brown.
​
# ASSEMBLE
​
- Start building the fattoush salad by adding all the chopped ingredients to a large bowl.
- Pour the dressing on top.
- Toss everything to combine well. But keep the pita bread on the side so that it can be added when served to stay crisp.
​
# TIPS FOR MAKING THE RECIPE
1. Use the freshest ingredients possible for the best salad. It can be hard to do that during the winter months, but selecting high quality fresh vegetables will create the best results!
2. Keep the fried pita on the side when serving. You can toss it on top right at the table or allow everyone enjoying the salad to add as much as they want.
3. Make the dressing in a blender or small food processor. That will really help to emulsify the dressing so that it doesn’t separate. If you’re mixing by hand, it helps to press or grate the garlic to keep it fine.
