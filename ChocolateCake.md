## Ingredients

* 150ml sunflower oil, plus extra for the tin
* 175g self-raising flour
* 2 tbsp cocoa powder
* 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda
* 150g caster sugar
* 2 tbsp golden syrup
* 2 large eggs, lightly beaten
* 150ml semi-skimmed milk

### For the icing
> 100g unsalted butter

> 225g icing sugar

> 40g cocoa powder

> 2Â½ tbsp milk (a little more if needed)

## Method

__Step 1:__ Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Oil and line the base of two 18cm sandwich tins. Sieve the flour, cocoa powder and bicarbonate of soda into a bowl. Add the caster sugar and mix well.

__Step 2:__ Make a well in the centre and add the golden syrup, eggs, sunflower oil and milk. Beat well with an electric whisk until smooth.

__Step 3:__ Pour the mixture into the two tins and bake for 25-30 mins until risen and firm to the touch. Remove from oven, leave to cool for 10 mins before turning out onto a cooling rack.

__Step 4:__ To make the icing, beat the unsalted butter in a bowl until soft. Gradually sieve and beat in the icing sugar and cocoa powder, then add enough of the milk to make the icing fluffy and spreadable.

__Step 5:__ Sandwich the two cakes together with the butter icing and cover the sides and the top of the cake with more icing.
